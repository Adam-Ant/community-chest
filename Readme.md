* Added BetterAchievements
* Added BetterFPS
  * Hopefully should slightly reduce CPU load on servers.
* Added HelpFixer
* Added RedstonePaste
* Removed AbyssalCraft
  * I really wanted to like AbyssalCraft, but it's just too invasive. From the huge biomes to the broken balence in the End, the mod is simply too hard and not fun to play.
* Removed NetherPortalFix
  * Doesnt seem to actually fix the issue, plus have ended up with players 2000+ blocks away in the nether - not fun :)
* Removed Infernal Mobs
  * Short of disabling 90% of the effects, the boss mobs generated are just too broken and too frequent.
* Removed Spice Of Life (plus AppleCore dep)
* Removed Translocators
* Optifine is no longer Not Recommended.
  * Shaders still behaving strangely - Use at your own risk!
* Updated 30+ mods!
